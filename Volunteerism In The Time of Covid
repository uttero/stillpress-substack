Alexander Vanyukov is a heart surgeon in Moscow, husband and father of two. Like all of us, Covid turned his life upside down. Only, he wasn’t hiding out in a country house making as needed dashes for groceries. He was at ground zero in a hazmat suit and goggles trying to prevent some of Russia’s 200,000 reported Covid deaths. Excess mortality suggests the actual figure is closer to 600,000.
As regular readers know, while I grew up in the US, I am fascinated by foreign cultures, particularly Russia. I’ve seen the pendulum swing from Soviet Union as enemy, to Russia as friend and back to Russia the enemy. When we are in the enemy phase, I detect a hardening of perspectives about the humanity of not just the government but the people of whomever one country or another holds as the current enemy. That’s why Alexander’s story leapt out. You can listen to the conversation here and also on Apple.
A few lessons I took away.
“If you need help, just ask.” Alexander saw a hospital overwhelmed and came up with the idea of putting out the call for volunteers. He thought a few people would respond. Thousands reached out.
Getting an outsider’s perspective is invaluable. “Their lack of medical experience and typical patient interactions was incredibly useful because they weren’t desensitized to the patients’ needs as most of the doctors are. So they were able to see certain issues, like someone who hasn’t been approached for a while, a lot more quickly than the medical staff,” he said.
Russia is experiencing a “crisis of trust.” Accomplishing difficult things that require a joint effort is so much harder where distrust is the starting point. I see the same thing in the US.
