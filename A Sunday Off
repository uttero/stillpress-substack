As noted in my New Yearâ€™s Day post, I took this week off from writing a longer essay and will return Sunday, 16 January. We are hard at work lining up and recording guests for Season #4 of our podcast, figuring out an interactive graphic to help you keep score of your money and editing, editing, editing book #2, tentatively called Mister, Minion. If you have questions about any of this, reach out.
When I need a break from the above, I take a stroll and marvel at how unusual the light is at this time of year. Below from an afternoon stroll.
Best,
Paul and the rest of the Still Press Team
