Today I mailed out a “subscriber-only” letter where I shared my asset allocation. This piece was the final part of a four-part series I called “The Lull.” If you’d like to read it, please become a paid subscriber.

Wednesday we release the next podcast, a conversation with Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, and the author of the best seller Principles. While Ray’s views on the economy and business are well known, I spoke with him about his childhood, starting Bridgewater and loss.

A genuine thanks to all of you for your interest and support.

Best,

Paul and the Still Press team
